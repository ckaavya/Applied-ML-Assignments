The function numpy_mean_stdev calculates the mean and the standard deviation of an array of numbers along a specified axis.

The arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided by the number of elements. The standard deviation is the squared root of the average on the squared values of deviation from the mean.

Assuming an array of numbers :math:`x_i`,


:math:`mean = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^n x_i}{n}`

:math:`sd = \sqrt {\frac{\sum_{i=0}^n (x_i- mean) ^ 2}{n}}`
